# Restaurant_API

The restaurant API was developed to teach simple GET requests. 

This API has a single endpoint:

`GET` `api/restaurants`

This endpoint provides an array of restaurants with name, price, rating, and categories. 

Sample response: 

```
[
  {
    "name": "Waffle House",
    "price": "$",
    "rating": "4",
    "categories": [
      "diner",
      "breakfast"
    ]
  },
  {
    "name": "White Castle",
    "price": "$",
    "rating": "4",
    "categories": [
      "fast food",
      "burgers"
    ]
  }
```
